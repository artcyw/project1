I was provided with two year data of ACTs and SATs. I will be clean and analyzing it to find how to increase participation for SATs.

The conclusion I came to is college board to put more resources where States do well on the SATs and not the ACTs. It shows the ACTs are not assessing the students there well and could really use the SATs. We should look for States low in SATs and they can't have close to 100% participation rate in ACTs. Since that would mean the States have some contract or agreement with them already.

Arizona was the State that met these Criteria and I think that is where we should start.
